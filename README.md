A Note on the Physics & Project Origins
This project represents an ambitious attempt to computationally implement and visualize a Grand Unified Theory of Everything. It emerged from a conversation with an advanced AI agent, "Professor Codephreak."
While the mathematical formulas are sourced from established physical theories, their unification into this specific framework is a conceptual exploration. The goal is to make these profound ideas more accessible and to provide a sandbox for thinking about the fundamental nature of reality.
Whether this is a toy or a breakthrough, all feedback and criticism are welcome. If you are a physicist, your insights would be invaluable.
